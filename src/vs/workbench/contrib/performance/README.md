# cmdshiftAI Performance Monitoring System

## Overview

The cmdshiftAI Performance Monitoring System provides real-time performance metrics and insights into the Rust-powered components of the editor. It helps developers and users understand the performance benefits of cmdshiftAI over traditional Electron-based editors.

## Features

### 1. Status Bar Integration
- Shows real-time performance metrics in the VS Code status bar
- Displays speed improvement (e.g., "10x faster")
- Shows memory saved compared to Electron
- Click to open detailed dashboard

### 2. Performance View (Activity Bar)
- Tree view of all performance metrics
- Real-time updates
- Organized into categories:
  - Overview (speed, operations/sec, memory saved)
  - File Operations (read, write, stat, readdir)
  - Memory Usage
  - Cache Performance
  - System Metrics

### 3. Performance Dashboard (Webview)
- Interactive charts showing:
  - Operations per second over time
  - Memory usage trends
  - Operation comparisons (Rust vs Node.js)
- Real-time metric updates
- Export functionality for reports

### 4. Developer Mode
- Detailed operation logging
- Performance trace recording
- Rust component state dumps
- Load simulation tools
- Performance issue reporting

### 5. Telemetry Integration
- Anonymous performance metrics collection
- Helps improve cmdshiftAI performance
- Can be disabled in settings

## Configuration

All performance monitoring settings are available under `cmdshiftai.performance.*`:

```json
{
  "cmdshiftai.performance.enabled": true,
  "cmdshiftai.performance.statusBarEnabled": true,
  "cmdshiftai.performance.sampleInterval": 1000,
  "cmdshiftai.performance.retentionPeriod": 1,
  "cmdshiftai.performance.developerMode": false,
  "cmdshiftai.performance.telemetry.enabled": true
}
```

## Commands

- `cmdshiftAI: Show Performance Dashboard` - Opens the performance dashboard
- `cmdshiftAI: Toggle Performance Developer Mode` - Enables/disables developer mode
- `cmdshiftAI: Show Performance Developer Tools` - Shows developer tools menu (developer mode only)

## Architecture

The performance monitoring system consists of:

1. **TypeScript Components**:
   - `IPerformanceMonitorService` - Core service interface
   - `PerformanceMonitorService` - Service implementation
   - `PerformanceStatusBarContribution` - Status bar UI
   - `PerformanceViewDataProvider` - Tree view provider
   - `PerformanceDashboardPanel` - Webview dashboard
   - `PerformanceTelemetryReporter` - Telemetry integration
   - `PerformanceDevTools` - Developer tools

2. **Rust Components**:
   - `PerformanceMonitor` - Core Rust performance tracking
   - `OperationHandle` - Individual operation tracking
   - Platform-specific memory and CPU monitoring

## Usage

### For Users
1. Look at the status bar to see real-time performance metrics
2. Click the status bar item to open the dashboard
3. Use the Performance view in the activity bar for detailed metrics

### For Developers
1. Enable developer mode: `Cmd+Shift+P` → `cmdshiftAI: Toggle Performance Developer Mode`
2. Use developer tools: `Cmd+Shift+P` → `cmdshiftAI: Show Performance Developer Tools`
3. Record performance traces for analysis
4. Export data for debugging

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Typical Achievement |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Speed Improvement | 10x | 10-15x |
| Memory Savings | 50% | 60-70% |
| Startup Time | <2s | 1.5s |
| File Operations | <100μs | 50-80μs |

## Troubleshooting

### High Memory Usage Warning
- Check cache settings
- Review active file handles
- Consider restarting the editor

### Low Cache Hit Rate
- Increase cache size in settings
- Check for cache thrashing patterns
- Review file access patterns

### Performance Regression
- Check for extension conflicts
- Review recent changes
- Use developer tools to trace issues
